The solutions in this folder are written for the Deno runtime.

## Running my solutions

1. Make sure [Deno](https://deno.land/) is installed
2. Run `deno test --allow-read`
   - To only run a specific day pass a folder, ex: `deno test --allow-read day1`
   - To use debugger run `deno test --allow-read --inspect-brk day1` and then attach with VSCode/Chrome.
